HallC Calibration
=================

This repository contains the HallC replay calibration files, formally known as 
the "CALIBRATION" directory.

This repository should be made a submodule of a coherent `EXPERIMENT_replay` 
repository (where EXPERIMENT is replaced with a unique experiment name). See 
https://github.com/whit2333/EXPERIMENT_replay for more details.

Note in the `EXPERIMENT_replay` the git-submodule will tag and always use a 
specific commit, so if calibrations are updated for more recent experiments 
this will not affect the calibrations used in older `EXPERIMENT_replay`s.
